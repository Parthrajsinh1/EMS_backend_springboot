 API Endpoints
----------------

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:9090`

### Employees

| Method | Endpoint           | Description              |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------|
| GET    | `/employees`      | Get all employees        |
| GET    | `/employees/{id}` | Get an employee by ID    |
| POST   | `/employees`      | Create a new employee    |
| PUT    | `/employees/{id}` | Update an existing employee |
| DELETE | `/employees/{id}` | Delete an employee by ID |

Error Handling
----------------

- When a requested employee does not exist, the application throws a `ResourceNotFoundException`.
- The `GlobalExceptionHandler` captures exceptions and returns consistent, structured JSON responses.

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-25T18:30:00",
  "message": "Employee not found with id 5",
  "details": "/employees/5"
}
